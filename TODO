1. Get Master Pi communicating on LAN with the following features

- A static IP

- Host a simple web page on Master Pi (Don't bother about aesthetics)

- The webpage should have 2 clickable buttons Device 1, Device 2;
   A word next to them saying ON or OFF; 
    Clicking on the button should toggle state.

- When the webpage is loaded on two different clients,
   Client 1 might press button for Device 1, switching the state of it;
    This should automatically get updated on Client 2.

- The states of Device 1 and 2 should be stored into the permanent memory
  (may be a file)(not just the RAM) of Rasp Pi,
   so that turning off and turning on the Rasp Pi 
    should retain the states of the devices.

 [WebServer platform to be used: Open to Research]


2. Boot the whole application at startup, so that powering on Master Pi should start the server.
