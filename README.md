* ABOUT:

This project aims at Open Source Home Automation; consists of three parts.. and here is an overview..

i] UI: The User Interface: This is where people interact with their entire system.. A Beautiful and highly customizable UI is what we anticipate to build, may it be an android app, iOS, windows app or just a HTML page..

ii] Master Pi: This is the brain of the system. All the intelligence sits here.. Master Pi monitors and controls everything: from turning on a light bulb to all sorts of intelligent predictions..

iii] I/Os: This is where all the action happens. These are individual peripheral devices and communicate 'wirelessly' with Master Pi. Data in or data out, the I/Os do every task.. Measuring power consumption to turning on Geysers to switching between TV channels, the I/Os rule..
